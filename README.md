I have been working in software development for years and have worked on a variety of projects during this time, including websites, web apps and mobile apps.

I am an avid amateur meteorologist and regularly observe the weather. I also love being in nature and observing plants.

n my professional career, I have specialized in website development. I have experience in various web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Vuejs. I am always looking for new challenges and opportunities to improve my skills.
